<p>I am quite a planner. However, sometimes the best things that happen to us are those which were not planned or intended. This is how I got to know <a href="http://www.zoobe.com/" target="_blank">Zoobe</a> in the first place, by complete coincidence. After a work day during my internship at the awesome <a href="http://delodi.net/en/index.html" target="_blank">Delodi UG</a>, I was on my way home when I noticed on <a href="meetup.com" target="_blank">Meetup</a> an event that claims to connect developers with startups. The event was one of the <a href="http://www.hackerx.org/" target="_blank">HackerX</a> events. I had the time to go there and it was taking place one minute away from home. Thus, I have decided to jump in and look for an internship for my coming summer vacation.</p>

<p>Event was over, met some cool companies and most of them asked me to apply for an internship which made me happy. I started moving out of the place to go back home when there was an eye contact with a gentleman who was saying "Prost". I had no idea what did this word mean so I was curious enough to ask. That's when I got to know about Zoobe GmbH and when I got to know about the possibility of not just doing a summer internship at Zoobe but actually writing my bachelor thesis at Zoobe under the supervision of Dr. <a href="http://www.zoobe.com/blog/meet-the-team-sascha-fagel" target="_blank">Sascha Fagel</a>.<img class="center-img" src="/img/zoobe-experience/sascha-coke.jpg" alt="coke" style="max-width: 40%; margin-left: 25%;"/></p>

<p>March 2nd, 2015 was my first day in Zoobe. Got my desktop set up and joined the backend team. The deal was to spend 20 hours per week researching and the other 20 working hours implementing some coding tasks assigned by Sascha. It felt different. Everything was absolutely different. It's a regular semester for me but I am not surrounded with my professors nor my friends and not even my university colleagues. I am even the only CS student from the GUC doing his bachelor project in Berlin. The closest friends where 700KM to the south in Stuttgart! Moreover, I am doing what they have been preparing us for at university, now I am in the industry and it's different.</p>

<p>One more thing that was different is that Zoobe is a product company. Around thirty talented people come to the same office to work on the same product. And it felt different from my previous internship experience at Delodi -I am not saying that Zoobe is better, it's just different-. At Delodi, we were mainly working for clients and sometimes self projects. But having a focused centered product did feel a lot different I have to say.

<h3>Pros of Zoobe</h3>

<p>If you have gone this far and you do not know what Zoobe is... I understand my friend, we always procrastinate. I will make it easier for you so you do not have to Google! Zoobe is an animated messaging application available on iOS and Android. For a two-year-old startup with almost 5 million downloads and 180 million created videos so far... It's really growing!</p>

<p>Back to the points, the pros...</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li><b>Research with Dr. Fagel</b></li>
	<p>Remember? That was the initial point why we are here. To get my bachelor thesis done. We were two students under the supervision of Dr. Fagel at the R&D department at Zoobe at my time . Keshant; who was working on his master thesis in the field of recommendation systems and me; working on my bachelor thesis in the same field.</p>
	<img class="center-img" src="/img/zoobe-experience/IMG_20150430_224854.jpg" /> <p align="center" class="caption">With Sascha and Keshant at an office party.

<p>There was a bi-weekly meeting at the Dark Room -I always used to laugh once I got the Google Calendar reminder notification, always reminds me of Berghain-. In that meeting, we used to discuss the work of the previous two weeks and I have to say that this meeting was always so inspiring, full of ideas and brainstorming solutions.</p>
<p>
	<img class="center-img" src="/img/zoobe-experience/calendar-event.png" /> <p align="center" class="caption">The calendar notification</p>
</p>
<p>One last thing concerning the research area, it was amazing to see this very special "A" on the transcript ;-)</p>

</p>
	<li><b>Team Diversity</b></li>

<p>The best thing about Zoobe is the team. An international team from 18 different countries. Only this was more than enough to make me smarter; to get to know about different cultures and backgrounds; to work closely with them and to have fun with them later on.</p>

<p>The team was the best thing when it comes to work-wise as well. The company was not only a tech company with "Left Brain Dominance" between the team members, but the diversity also included artists, designers, singers, and a lot more, not only geeks.</p>

<p>You do have a question in Android? Go ask Sam, Haneen or Gonzo. They are the experts! Got a question related to iOS? Tomás, Josh and Fatih are there for you. Curious about sound engineering and signals? Andreas is the best! Maybe you have a design issue and you are seeking advice? The amazing <a href="http://www.zoobe.com/blog/meet-the-team-pathie" target="_blank">Pathie</a> is there for you! Want to understand something in the Zoobe architecture? Jorge did explain a lot. What about a Java bug which you have been trying to debug for the last couple of hours? Here comes the mighty Arun! Or maybe you need a frontend ninja? Keshant indeed is the one! C++ specialist? The special Agustin! The best thing about the experience was also having a seat directly next to Sascha where it was very easy to spam him with my stupid questions whenever I have one. Not just on a technical level, do you need help with a blog post review? I have just asked Monica to help me review this one!</p>

<p>Thus the team diversity was not just about coming from different countries but also a diversity in knowledge, experience and various backgrounds which was indeed super healthy for everyone within the team.</p>

	<li><b>The Startup Culture</b></li>
<p>This is a really important thing that I did learn. It just feels great when we all meet on Monday morning for the weekly meeting and you see how everyone is pushing himself/herself to the limits to push the whole company forward. You hear about Lenard's adventures here and there. Norbert's connections which are making Zoobe more and more popular all over the globe. I didn't really feel the hierarchy that my friends used to tell me about at big companies. Everybody's mission is to make this company better and you can very easily get recognized for your work.</p>

<p>And if one day, you want to start your own thing. You definitely need to live such a startup culture at least once. ;-)</p>

<p> 

</p>

	<li><b>Activities & Berlin</b></li>

<p>One cool fact about Zoobe is that the office lies in the center of Berlin und BERLIN ist so Wunderbar! I am sorry for this, but it's not Kaiserslautern. It's Berlin, the crazy city with activities going on everywhere in each and every corner of this city. Cooking with Haneen and Keshant in the office kitchen is something I am so missing at the current moment.</p>

<p>Making Monica's invention of watermelon-mint-vodka was indeed a great day. Helping out in Zoobe's booth at some events  </p>

<p>And if you are bored, just go wander in the city, for sure you will find something that will definitely make your day. Like this one maybe...</p>

<p>We do work hard, but we play harder! I remember that there was a dodgeball league for startups in Berlin. We had a Zoobe team that was rocking the competition and we scored the second place!</p>

<p>One amazing thing, was football with Sascha every Wednesday. And it was amazing to meet a German player wearing ElZamalek Sports Club T-shirt during one of the games!</p>

<p>You get Zoobes!!! and YES they are cool! Here is a special one I got on my Birthday</p>

<p>Office parties are defintely good. And during such parties the dark room - in which we have the bachelor meetings - become REALLY the place. During one of the parties, Lenard was showing how "Eslam" is written using some body language technique that he learnt at school - I should ask for the name of those movements, they are really interesting to read about.</p>

<h3>Cons of doing the bachelor thesis at Zoobe</h3>
<p>Zoobe is such a great place, but since nothing on our lovely planet is perfect. I faced some difficulties...</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li><b>Away from friends?</b></li>
<p>I did feel a bit lonely for the first couple of minutes I have to say. It was different than  university classes. I never entered a class unless I do know everybody who is sitting around. But I have to say that this lasted for only a couple of minutes. Everybody at Zoobe was super friendly!</p>
<p>It was also really good to step away for some time. In order to give myself some time to discover new things about me. And I defintely did ;-)</p>
<p>But, then I invited some friends to come over to Berlin and they were shocked by how amazing Berlin is. It was great to show them around and it was even greater when I went to Stuttgart and they took me around.</p>

<img style="margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;" src="/img/zoobe-experience/IMG_20150719_191915.jpg" target="_blank" /> <p align="center" class="caption">with Salma, Farghal & Bassem at Tempelhof, Zoobe became greater when Bassem joined the team in August.</p>

	
	<li><b>Missing the extra-curricular activities at the university?</b></li>

<p> I did something smart about it. I joined AIESEC at Humboldt-Universität. Worked along with the GCDP team and made amazing friendships with the coolest people on this planet. I really cannot wait to meet each and everyone of them again</p>

<img style="margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;" src="/img/zoobe-experience/11709811_913666392048522_4095333272165715609_o.jpg" target="_blank"/> <p align="center" class="caption">LCM Drinks</p>
	
	<li><b>Time Management</b></li>
<p>This is by far the most important thing I should have taken care of. Sometimes I didn't split my 20-20 working hours plan but I got so excited about some tasks so I forgot about my research duties or I am in a rush due to a deadline submission so I delayed some tasks to catch up the thesis submission deadline. My last 4 days were the most painful ones as I had to write the thesis, cross the 't's and dot the 'i's, and ask Keshant for the proof reading. But I survived. So yes, time management is a very important skill which I am still trying to enhance :-)</p>
</ul>

<p>I have one task for YOU! If you ever make it to Zoobe, you should ask about the story behind the below mysterious picture. You will love the story!</p>

<p align="center" class="caption">The mysterious picture</p>

<p>Last but not least, it was a unique experience. An amazing one. The journey that did change a lot in me. A step that I would never regret doing. And I know one fact for sure, if I went back in time, I would take the same decision :-)</p>

<p>Dear Zoobes, I missed a lot of details in this blog post to make it short. But I would never forget one single memory. Thank you! :-)</p>
